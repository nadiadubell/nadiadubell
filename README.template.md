Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nadia DuBell a results oriented Software Developer with experience in React JS for creating interactive user interfaces. Strong understanding of object-oriented programming and back end technologies. Software Developer with professional Graphic Design experience. Five years of producing high-quality media has given me the unique perspective of front end design and layout as well as customer and user objectives. I realized my passion for creative problem solving would be best utilized by becoming a developer. It was a natural gravitation to my current career path of writing JavaScript across the full stack for web applications.
